Optical Character Recognition Through Minimum Distance Classifier

A Minimum Distance Classifier attempts to classify an unlabelled sample to a class which minimise the
distance between the sample and the class in multi-feature space. As minimising distance is a measure
for maximising similarity, MDC actually assigns data to its most similar category
